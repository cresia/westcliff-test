                  in
                  a family too much and will try to guard that person from the other members of the family, if allowed.</p>

                <p>Poncho's now obedience trained, so much less fearful, so much more trusting, and so responsive with the people who
                  have
                  worked with him. He needs an adopter who can spend time with him, prior to adoption, as he doesn't trust strangers. We
                  will work with you and Poncho- getting you both to the point where he trusts you and can leave with you. He just needs
                  someone who can spend the time to show him structure, boundaries, and work on continuing his socialization, and this
                  boy will have you smiling from ear to ear for years to come.</p>

                <p>Odin is so handsome and bonds so quickly, it's hard to imagine how he landed at the shelter in the first place. We've
                  found this big boy, who is 4 years old, to be a happy guy who loves water, chasing down balls, is working on his leash
                  skills, has no bad reaction towards other dogs while on leash, and loves going for walks around town. He would like
                  someone with GSD experience to give him structure and, in return, you'll get an amazingly loyal companion who will be
                  your best friend for life.</p>
